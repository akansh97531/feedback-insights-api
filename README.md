# üéØ Professional Network Matching Engine MVP

An AI-powered professional networking platform that uses Cohere's state-of-the-art language models to provide intelligent connection recommendations based on natural language queries.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `app/main.py`: Main FastAPI application with networking endpoints
- `app/services/network_matching_engine.py`: Core matching engine orchestrating all components
- `app/services/cohere_service.py`: Cohere API integration for embeddings and query processing
- `app/services/similarity_engine.py`: Multi-metric similarity scoring system
- `app/services/synthetic_data_generator.py`: Generates realistic professional network data
- `app/services/mock_graph_db.py`: In-memory graph database using NetworkX
- `test_networking_engine.py`: Comprehensive test script with sample queries

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üß† Natural Language Processing**: Query like "Find AI engineers at Google" using Cohere's language models
- **üìä Multi-Metric Similarity**: Combines semantic similarity, relationship strength, mutual connections, company overlap, and education matching
- **üìß Email Generation**: Automated introduction email drafts using Cohere's chat models
- **üîó Graph Analysis**: Connection path finding and mutual connection discovery
- **‚ö° Fast Embeddings**: Cached Cohere embed-v4.0 vectors for semantic matching

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development

#### 1. Installation dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 2. Set up Cohere API key in .env
cp .env.example .env
# Add this line to your .env file:
# COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here

#### 3. Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

#### 4. In a new terminal, run the test script
python test_networking_engine.py

### Railway Deployment

#### 1. Prerequisites
- Railway account: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository with your code
- Cohere API key

#### 2. Deploy to Railway
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
   PORT=8000
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```
3. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect the configuration and deploy

#### 3. Railway Configuration Files
- `railway.json`: Railway deployment configuration
- `Procfile`: Process definition for web server
- `.env.railway`: Environment variables template

#### 4. Access Your API
- Railway will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
- Health check: `GET /health`
- API documentation: `GET /docs`

# 5. For a quick demo (faster):
python test_networking_engine.py quick

# 6. Access the API docs at:
# http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## üéÆ How It Works

### 1. Initialize the Network
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/initialize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"num_profiles": 50}'
```

### 2. Find Professional Connections
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/find-connections" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requester_id": "user-id-here",
    "query": "Find AI engineers who have worked at Google or DeepMind",
    "max_results": 5
  }'
```

### 3. Generate Introduction Email
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-introduction" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requester_id": "user-id-here",
    "target_id": "target-user-id",
    "context": "collaboration on AI research projects"
  }'
```

## üéØ API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/initialize` | POST | Initialize network with synthetic professional data |
| `/find-connections` | POST | Find networking matches using natural language queries |
| `/generate-introduction` | POST | Generate personalized introduction emails |
| `/network-stats` | GET | Get network statistics and insights |
| `/profiles` | GET | List professional profiles with filtering |
| `/health` | GET | Health check and system status |

## üß™ Example Queries

The system understands natural language networking queries:

- **"Find AI engineers who have worked at Google or DeepMind"**
- **"Connect me to senior product managers with startup experience"** 
- **"Looking for data scientists in healthcare or biotech"**
- **"Find software engineers with Python and machine learning skills"**
- **"Connect me to VPs or directors in technology companies"**

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Multi-Metric Similarity Scoring
- **Semantic Similarity (25%)**: Cohere embed-v4.0 cosine similarity
- **Relationship Strength (20%)**: Email interaction frequency and recency
- **Mutual Connections (15%)**: LinkedIn network overlap
- **Company Overlap (15%)**: Current and past company matches
- **Education Similarity (10%)**: University and degree matching
- **Query Relevance (15%)**: Structured criteria matching

### Cohere API Integration
- **embed-v4.0**: 1536-dimensional semantic embeddings
