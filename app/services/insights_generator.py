CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT:
"{transcript[:1000]}"

ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
Based on the conversation patterns, customers frequently mention:
- Export functionality failures (3/5 success rate)
- Pricing page confusion and unclear value propositions
- Long customer support wait times (20+ minutes)
- Need for API integrations and higher usage limits
- Checkout abandonment due to unclear benefits

- sentiment_score: -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive)
