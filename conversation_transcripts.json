      "transcript": "Agent: Hi Ram, this is Rachel from TechFlow Analytics reaching out. We've received the feedback score you recently shared with us, and we'd love to understand more about your experience. How's your experience been? User: Product is fine. Agent: Just fine? That sounds like there might be room for improvement - what would make it better for you? User: Better reporting tools. Agent: Oh, that's really helpful feedback. What kind of reporting are you trying to do that's not working well right now? User: We're hitting some walls with the export limitations Agent: That's frustrating - export limitations can really slow things down. What are you trying to export that's getting blocked? User: and some data about 15 MB. Agent: Fifteen megabytes hitting a limit is definitely a pain point. What brought you to check us out in the first place - were you specifically looking for better reporting capabilities? User: That's right, yes. Agent: I noticed you were checking out our pricing earlier - how'd that go? Were you looking at which plan might handle those larger exports? User: That's right, yeah. I spent ages trying to figure out if upgrading would actually fix it or if it's a system-wide issue. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating - spending all that time trying to figure out if upgrading would even solve your problem. What made it so hard to tell from the pricing page? User: The feature comparison was vagueâ€”like what does enhanced export actually mean? Better speed? Higher limits? Or both. Agent: That's such a valid point - \"enhanced export\" could mean anything! Did you end up finding any clearer details about the actual limits, or are you still in the dark about what each plan actually gets you? User: Yeah, I'm still in the dark. I couldn't figure out what each plan, um... You know, helped me to unblock myself. Agent: That's really frustrating that you're still stuck not knowing which plan would actually solve your fifteen megabyte export issue. Besides the export limitations and unclear pricing, anything else about the product that's been on your mind? User: I've tried calling the customer support, but the wait was too long. Gave up after 20 minutes. Agent: Twenty minutes on hold and then giving up? That's completely unacceptable, especially when you're trying to make a purchasing decision. How long has the export issue been blocking your work? User: For about a week now. Agent: A whole week of being blocked on exports - that's really impacting your work. This has been really helpful understanding what you're going through. Is there anything else you'd want us to know about your experience? User: No. Agent: Perfect, really appreciate you taking the time to share all this feedback with me. This is exactly the kind of insight that helps us improve. Thanks Ram! Agent: None Agent: None"

We've received the feedback score you recently shared with us, and we'd love to understand more about your experience. How's your experience been? User: It's okay. The product does what we need mostly Agent: Just okay? That sounds like there's room for improvement - what would make it better for you? User: Well, we're running into some limitations with the current setup. The exports keep timing out. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating, I'm sorry you're dealing with that. How often are these timeouts happening to you? User: Pretty much daily. Three out of five exports fail. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable. How long has this been happening? User: Been happening pretty consistently over the past week. Agent: That's a serious issue affecting your daily workflow. What brought you to check us out initially - were you evaluating us for anything specific? User: No Agent: Got it. What were you hoping to accomplish when you first started using TechFlow Analytics? User: Product analytics features. Agent: Makes sense. I noticed you were checking out our pricing earlier - how'd that go? User: Yeah, I was poking around trying to understand our options. Agent: What were you trying to figure out about the options? User: I spent time trying to figure out if upgrading would actually fix it or if it's a system-wide issue. Agent: That's a smart approach - you want to make sure upgrading would actually solve the export timeout problem before investing more. What conclusion did you reach? User: The feature comparison was vague, like what does enhanced exports really mean? Better speed, higher limits, both. Agent: That's really valuable feedback - the vague feature descriptions are clearly making it hard to evaluate if upgrading would solve your export issues. Thanks for taking the time to share all this with me, it's incredibly helpful for improving both our product and how we communicate about it! Agent: None Agent: None"

User: Well, we're running into some limitations with our current setup. The exports keeps timing out Agent: Oh that's really frustrating, I'm sorry you're dealing with that. How often are the exports timing out on you? User: Pretty much daily now. Three out of five exports fail. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable. How long has this been happening? User: It's been happening for the past couple of days Agent: That's really concerning - a sixty percent failure rate on something you need daily is a serious issue. Are these large exports or does it happen regardless of size? User: Regardless. Agent: That makes it even worse if it's happening on all export sizes. Besides the export issues, what brought you to check us out originally? User: I needed a solution for my product analytics. Agent: Got it. And are you evaluating us for anything specific right now, or are you already using us for your analytics needs? User: No. Agent: I'm not sure I caught that - are you saying you're not currently using us, or you're not evaluating us for anything specific? Just want to make sure I understand where you're at. User: I'm not evaluating for anything specific. Agent: Ah okay, so you're already using us for your product analytics. That makes sense. I... User: Yes Agent: I noticed you were checking out our pricing earlier - how'd that go? User: ... Agent: Are you still there? I was asking about how looking at our pricing went for you. User: ... Agent: Hello? Just want to make sure we're still connected. If you're having any... User: Yeah Agent: Great! So when you were... User: . The feature comparison was vague like what does enhanced exports really mean better speed higher limits both Agent: That's a really good point - \"enhanced exports\" is pretty vague, especially when you're dealing with timeout issues. What specific details would have been most helpful to see in that comparison? User: Yeah, I actually got all the way to the checkout but then backed out couldn't justify the cost without knowing if it would have solved my problem Agent: That makes total sense - you can't justify spending more when you're not sure it'll actually fix the export timeouts you're dealing with. What would you have needed to see to feel confident about making that jump? User: ... Agent: Are you still there? I was asking what information would have helped you... User: Yeah. Agent: What... User: Yeah, I mean, explicit value additions, or is it better speed, higher limits, or both? Agent: Absolutely - you need to know if \"enhanced exports\" means faster processing that would fix your timeout issues, or just higher volume limits, or both. That's exactly the kind of clarity that should be upfront. Besides the export problems and pricing confusion, anything else on your mind about the platform? User: The analytics dashboards are great, really powerful. It's just this export button bottlenecks that's killing us. Agent: That's fantastic that the dashboards are working so well for you! It sounds like the core analytics functionality is really clicking, which makes the export bottleneck even more frustrating since it's blocking you from getting the most out of the platform. This has been really helpful - anything else you'd want us to know? User: Nothing! Agent: Perfect! Really appreciate you taking the time to share all this feedback about the export issues and pricing clarity. This is incredibly valuable for us. Take care! Agent: None Agent: None"

We've received the feedback score you recently shared with us, and we'd love to understand more about your experience. How's your experience been? User: It's been all right, I guess. Having some ups and downs. Agent: Just all right? That sounds like there's definitely room for improvement. What's been causing those ups and downs for you? User: Well, I've been having some issues with the export feature and I was looking at upgrading a plan but got a bit confused. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating - dealing with export issues while trying to figure out plans sounds like a real pain. Let me ask about the export problems first - what's been happening when you try to export? User: It's just failing about three out of five times. It just kills the productivity. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable - I'm really sorry you're dealing with that. How long has this been happening to you? User: For the last week. Agent: A whole week of that failure rate is awful - that must be incredibly disruptive to your work. Have you had to find workarounds, or is it just blocking you completely when it fails? User: It's just blocking my workflows. Agent: That's terrible - having your workflows completely blocked is exactly the kind of thing that shouldn't happen. On a different note, you mentioned getting confused about upgrading plans - what was confusing about that process? User: ... Agent: Are you still there? I want to make sure I... User: Yeah, I was trying to figure out what exactly we'd get with enterprise tiers versus what we have now. And the what's included section wasn't super clear. Agent: That makes total sense - it's frustrating when you're ready to invest more but can't clearly see what you'd be getting for your money. What specific features or capabilities were you hoping to understand better? User: Mainly higher export limits and batch processing. We need to export large datasets daily and it's becoming a real bottleneck. Agent: Ah, so the export issues you're having are even more critical because it's a daily workflow need - that explains why the three out of five failure rate is so disruptive. When you were looking at the enterprise tiers, could you tell what the export limits would actually be, or was that part of what wasn't clear? User: Yeah, it wasn't clear to me. Agent: Got it - so you're dealing with export failures on your current plan and can't even tell if upgrading would solve the problem because the limits aren't clearly explained. That's a really frustrating spot to be in. Besides the export and pricing clarity issues, anything else that's been on your mind with the platform? User: No. Agent: This has been really helpful - sounds like getting those export issues fixed and making the plan benefits clearer would make a huge difference for you. Anything else you'd want us to know? User: No. Agent: Perfect, really appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback Ram. We'll definitely look into both the export reliability issues and making our plan benefits much clearer. Thanks again! Agent: None Agent: None"

What brought you to check us out in the first place? User: I was looking for some products too for product analytics and the product seemed promising. Agent: Nice! Sounds like you're doing some research for product analytics tools. How's that evaluation process going for you - are you finding what you need? User: Been having some issues with the export feature and I was looking at upgrading the plan but got a bit confused. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating about the export feature - I'm sorry you're running into issues there. And I can totally understand getting confused when looking at upgrading plans. What specifically was confusing about the plan options? User: Yeah, I was trying to figure out what exactly we'd get with enterprise tiers versus what we have now. The watts included section wasn't super clear Agent: That makes complete sense - it's really important to understand exactly what you're getting before making that jump to enterprise. When you say the \"what's included\" section wasn't super clear, what specific parts left you wondering? Was it more about the features themselves or how they'd work for your use case? User: Mainly the higher export limits and batch processing we need to export large data sets and it's becoming a real bottleneck. Agent: Ah, so the export bottleneck is a real workflow issue for you - that's definitely something that needs solving. When you were looking at the enterprise tier, could you tell what the actual export limits would be, or was that part of what was unclear? User: That was part of what was unclear. Agent: Got it - so you need those higher export limits to handle your large datasets, but the pricing page didn't make it clear what those actual limits would be on enterprise. That's definitely something we need to fix. Besides the export confusion, anything else about your experience that's been on your mind? User: Nothing really Agent: Perfect, really appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback about the export limits and pricing clarity - this is super helpful for us to improve!

User: Yeah, the product was referred, recommended to me by a friend who was in a similar function in a different company. Agent: Nice, word of mouth recommendations are the best! What kind of function are you in, if you don't mind me asking? User: Product analytics. Agent: Perfect, that makes total sense for our platform. Did you find what you were looking for when you started exploring our features and pricing? User: Not really. The pricing page is a bit confusing. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating, I'm sorry you're dealing with that. What specifically about the pricing was confusing for you?

We need to export large data sets daily and it's becoming a real bottleneck. Agent: That's a critical workflow issue - daily bottlenecks can really slow down your whole team. How bad is the current export situation? Are you hitting limits every day or just occasionally? User: About three out of every five attempts, it's stalling productivity. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable and I can see why you'd be looking at enterprise. When those exports fail, how long does it typically take to get them working again? User: I couldn't tell if it's higher tiers would solve the problem timeouts or just give us more failed attempts. Agent: That's a really valid concern - you need to know it'll actually solve the problem, not just give you more ways to hit the same wall. Besides the export and batch processing issues, anything else about the platform that's been on your mind? User: The analytics has been good. The custom view saves us hours every week. It's just the export situation that's making us consider alternatives. Agent: Love hearing that the analytics and custom views are working so well for you! It sounds like the export bottleneck is really the main thing standing between you and being completely happy with the platform. This has been really helpful - anything else you'd want us to know about your experience or what would make the decision easier? User: Yeah, I mean, if you can fix that, I think that'll be great.

What kind of role are you in, and what were you hoping TechFlow might help you with? User: I'm a product manager and I'm hoping to use the product to do product analytics. Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what we're built for! How's the research process been going for you so far - have you found what you were looking for? User: Yeah, all good. Agent: Just good? What would make it better for you? I noticed you spent some time on our pricing page earlier - how'd that go? User: Yeah, the pricing page is not very intuitive. I wanted to upgrade to a better tier but no. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating, I'm sorry you're dealing with that. What specifically made it confusing when you were trying to upgrade? User: So the value add for higher tiers were not very obvious or evident Agent: That makes total sense - if you can't see what you're getting for the extra cost, why would you upgrade? What kind of features or capabilities were you hoping to find in the higher tiers that weren't clear? User: API integrations and a lot more token usage Agent: Ah, so you needed API access and higher usage limits - those are pretty core needs for a PM doing serious analytics work. Were those features mentioned somewhere but just not clearly explained, or were they completely missing from the plan descriptions? User: It was not clearly mentioned. Agent: Got it, so the information was buried or unclear rather than missing entirely. That's definitely something we need to fix.

Have a great rest of your day, Sarah."

      "transcript": "Agent: Hey Sarah, this is Doppler reaching out. We've received the feedback score you recently shared with us, and we'd love to understand more about your experience. How's your experience been?? User: It is good so far. Agent: That's great to hear! What brought you to check us out in the first place? User: I was referred to a friend from a different company who was in the same position. Agent: Nice, always good when someone you trust recommends something. What were you and your friend trying to solve - what made them think Doppler would be a good fit for you? User: We work on the same use case and he found Doppler to be useful, so he had recommended me to try it out. Agent: That makes sense! I noticed you spent some time on our pricing page earlier - how'd that go for you? User: Yeah, so I checked out to upgrade to higher pricing tiers, but I decided not to proceed. Agent: Oh, I can understand that - pricing decisions can be tricky. What made you pause when you got to checkout? User: The value proposition for higher tiers were not very evident. Agent: That's really helpful feedback - sounds like it wasn't clear what extra value you'd get for the higher price. When you were comparing the plans, what specifically were you hoping to see that would justify the upgrade? User: More usage quotas and a lot more functionality, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the pricing information. Agent: Got it, so you needed higher limits and more features but couldn't tell from the pricing page what exactly you'd get. That's frustrating when you're ready to spend more but can't see the value clearly. Besides the pricing clarity, how's everything else been working for you so far? User: Yeah, I have some problems with the export button. Agent: Oh that's annoying - export issues can really disrupt your workflow. What's happening when you try to use the export button? User: It doesn't export. So three out of five times when I tried it just doesn't work. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable - I'm really sorry you're dealing with that. How long has this been happening, and is it affecting your ability to get your work done? User: Yes, it does. It's been happening for the last two weeks and I had to find a workaround to do that. Agent: That's really frustrating that you've had to work around a broken feature for two weeks. What workaround did you end up having to use, and have you been able to reach out to support about the export issue? User: I did reach out to the support team but we took long waiting hours. I couldn't raise an issue Agent: Oh wow, long wait times on top of a broken feature - that's a really poor experience, I'm sorry about that. How long were you waiting when you tried to get help? And what workaround did you end up using to get your exports done? User: I took screenshots of it. Agent: Screenshots as a workaround for exports - that's definitely not ideal and shows how much this issue is impacting you. This has been really helpful feedback. Besides the export problems and pricing clarity, is there anything else on your mind about your experience with Doppler? User: No, Agent: Perfect, I really appreciate you taking the time to share all this with us. The export issue and pricing clarity feedback are both really valuable - we'll definitely get this back to the team. Thanks again for being so open about your experience! User: Thank you! Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, Sarah!"

      "transcript": "Agent: Hey Sarah, this is Doppler reaching out. We've received the feedback score you recently shared with us, and we'd love to understand more about your experience. Could you tell me what influenced your rating? User: It was okay. The product is good. Agent: Got it, sounds like it's working well for you overall. What do you find yourself using most in Doppler? User: I use the analytics dashboard. Agent: Nice! What kind of insights are you getting from the dashboard that are most helpful? User: I use it mostly for executive reporting and tracking the business health metrics. Agent: That's great that it's helping with those executive reports. On a different note, how did you first discover Doppler? User: It was referred to one of my friends from a different company. Agent: That's awesome - friend recommendations are the best! What made you decide to actually give it a try after they mentioned it? User: I had a similar use case in my current work, and I thought I'll give it a spin. Agent: Makes sense! How's the setup process been for you? Was it pretty straightforward to get going? User: Yeah, yeah, it was good, yeah. Agent: Perfect! Besides the analytics dashboard, what else stands out about your experience so far? User: I like the export option which enables me to get the data out in spreadsheets and analyze in a different tool. Agent: That's really useful! What tool do you typically export to for your analysis? User: I export to Excel Agent: Got it, Excel makes sense for that kind of work. Switching gears a bit - when you were first evaluating Doppler, was there anything that made you hesitant or unsure about moving forward? User: No. Agent: That's great it was a clear decision for you. What about pricing - how did that feel when you were looking at the different options? User: Pricing was a bit confusing for me. I wasn't able to clearly distinguish between the value proposition between the different pricing tiers. Agent: Oh that's frustrating, I'm sorry you had that experience. What specifically made it hard to see the differences between the plans? User: The value prop was not quite explicit between the different pricing tiers. Agent: I can see why that would be confusing. Did you end up reaching out to anyone for help, or did you figure it out on your own? User: Yeah, I tried reaching the customer support, but due to the long waiting time, I had to hang up. Agent: Oh that's really frustrating, I'm sorry about that. How long were you waiting before you had to hang up? User: About 20 minutes. Agent: Twenty minutes is way too long - that's completely unacceptable. How did you eventually figure out which plan to go with? User: I didn't make my decision. I stuck to the free version. Agent: Got it, so you're still on the free version. That makes sense given the confusion with the pricing. What would need to happen for you to consider upgrading to a paid plan? User: I would like a better and clear value proposition for me to consider moving to a higher tier. Agent: That makes total sense. Besides clearer value propositions, is there anything else that would make the upgrade decision easier for you? User: No. Agent: This has been really helpful feedback - anything else on your mind about your Doppler experience that you'd want us to know? User: Not at the moment. Agent: Perfect, really appreciate you taking the time to share all this with me! Your feedback about the pricing clarity and support wait times is super valuable. Thanks Sarah! User: Thank you Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day!"

Could you tell me what influenced your rating? User: It was okay. I had trouble with the export button. Agent: Oh that's frustrating, I'm sorry you ran into that. What exactly happened when you tried to export? User: I tried a couple of times to export into a PDF format, but it consistently failed. Agent: That's really annoying when something just won't work. How often were you trying to use the export feature? User: Three out of five times I tried to use it and three out of five times it didn't work. Agent: Three out of five times? That's completely unacceptable, I'm really sorry you're dealing with that. How long has this been happening for you? User: It's been happening for the last couple of days. Agent: That's really disruptive to have something fail that consistently. Besides the export issues, what other parts of the product do you use regularly? User: I use the analytics dashboard which I find quite useful. Agent: That's great that the dashboard is working well for you! What specifically do you find most useful about the analytics? User: I like the fact that I'm able to design custom views to create custom analytics views. Agent: Love that the customization is clicking for you! On a different note, what originally made you decide to try Doppler? User: It was referred to one of my friends from a different company who used and he liked the user experience. Agent: That's awesome - friend recommendations are the best. How long have you been using it now? User: I've been using it for the past month and so far the experience has been good apart from the export option. Agent: Makes sense - sounds like overall it's been positive aside from that export bug. What made you end up on our pricing page recently? User: I wanted to upgrade to the pro version. Agent: That's great to hear you're considering upgrading! What's driving that decision for you? User: I want to unlock more features, especially the API integrations, Agent: Nice, the API integrations are really powerful. When you were looking at the pricing page, was there anything that felt unclear or made you hesitate? User: Yes. I wasn't very clear about the distinction between the features that were available in the starter pack versus the pro version. So I wasn't sure whether the pro version would add more value to me. Agent: That's really helpful feedback - sounds like the feature comparison wasn't clear enough. What specific features were you trying to figure out if they were worth the upgrade? User: For me, the API integrations and latency on the API was the key, and I couldn't get that information from a Python page. Agent: Got it, so you needed more technical details about API performance that weren't available. Besides that, anything else on your mind about your Doppler experience? User: A batch processing feature would be pretty useful. Agent: That makes sense - batch processing could definitely streamline workflows. This has been really helpful feedback, Sarah. Anything else you'd want us to know about your experience? User: Nothing as of now. I think these are the top of mind items for me. Agent: Perfect, really appreciate you taking the time to share all this with us! We'll definitely look into that export issue and the pricing page clarity. Thanks again, Sarah! User: Thank you! Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, Sarah!"
